# E2E testing

## Idea

E2E ensures that all components of the system are coherent.  
In our regard, it insures that the game is playable in the first place and preferably beatable.

## Mechanism implementation

General idea is too feed game input from the start and match the output.  
If a certain chain of commands leads to the end, then everything is good.
